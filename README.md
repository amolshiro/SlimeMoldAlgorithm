# Slime Mold Algorithm
Slime molds (Physarum polycephalum) have a unique ability to optimize paths to food sources. We are running physical tests with slime molds in complex mazes to develop a shortest path algorithm in Python mimicking the behavior of Physarum polycephalum. Presented at Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE) Annual Conference 2024 in Montreal. Published in associated conference journal.
